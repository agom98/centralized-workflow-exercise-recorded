# Quiche Lorraine Recipe

## Ingredients
- **Pastry:**
  - 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
  - 1/2 cup cold butter, cubed
  - 1/4 cup ice water
  - Pinch of salt

- **Filling:**
  - 6 slices bacon, chopped
  - 1 cup shredded Gruy√®re cheese
  - 1 cup heavy cream
  - 1 cup milk
  - 3 large eggs
  - 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
  - Salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions

### Pastry
1. **Prepare the pastry:** In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the cold butter and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
2. **Add ice water:** Gradually add ice water, mixing until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.
3. **Roll out the dough:** On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Transfer the dough to the dish, trim the edges, and prick the bottom with a fork. Refrigerate while preparing the filling.

### Filling
4. **Cook the bacon:** In a skillet over medium heat, cook the chopped bacon until crispy. Drain on paper towels.
5. **Combine ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, milk, nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
6. **Assemble the quiche:** Sprinkle the cooked bacon and shredded Gruy√®re cheese evenly over the pastry. Pour the egg mixture over the top.

### Baking
7. **Bake:** Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F (190¬∞C). Bake the quiche for 35-40 minutes, or until the filling is set and the top is golden brown.
8. **Cool:** Allow the quiche to cool slightly before slicing and serving.
